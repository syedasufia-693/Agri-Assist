# Agri-Assist

Welcome to Agri-Assist Project, an innovative agricultural application designed to tackle key challenges in farming using cutting-edge technology. This project, developed with the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack and integrated with a Flask API, encompasses two distinct modules. These modules cater to crop-related issues and enable yield marketing through an intuitive e-commerce platform.

## Features

### Crop-related Issues Module

* **Plant Disease Prediction:** Employing advanced algorithms to predict and identify plant diseases for proactive management.
* **Crop Selection:** Utilizes detailed soil and climate information to recommend suitable crops for cultivation.

### Yield Marketing Module

* **E-commerce Platform:** Empowering farmers to seamlessly post and sell their crops, creating a dynamic virtual marketplace.
* **User Roles:** Designed for farmers and common people for purchasing.

## Technologies Used

* **Frontend:** Developed with React, utilizing CSS frameworks such as MUI and react-bootstrap.
* **Middleware:** Leveraging Express.js for efficient communication between frontend and backend.
* **Backend:** Powered by Node.js for orchestrating complex operations.
* **API:** Flask, providing additional functionality and seamless integration.
* **Database:** MongoDB stores user credentials, while AWS S3 bucket is used for image storage. Now Google Cloud Platform has been introduced to store images through Google Drive API.
